  // before it is disconnected from the backend and discarded
  // default is 10000 (10 seconds) - set to 0 to disable auto-disconnection of idle clients
  idleTimeoutMillis: 10000,

  // by default this is set to 10.  There is some nuance to setting the maximum size of your pool.

  max: 10,
 
  // minimum number of clients the pool should hold on to and _not_ destroy with the idleTimeoutMillis
  // this can be useful if you get very bursty traffic and want to keep a few clients around.
  // note: current the pool will not automatically create and connect new clients up to the min, it will
  // only not evict and close clients except those which exceed the min count.
  // the default is 0 which disables this behavior.
  min: 0,
 
  // Default behavior is the pool will keep clients open & connected to the backend
  // until idleTimeoutMillis expire for each client and node will maintain a ref
  // to the socket on the client, keeping the event loop alive until all clients are closed
  // after being idle or the pool is manually shutdown with `pool.end()`.
  //
  // Setting `allowExitOnIdle: true` in the config will allow the node event loop to exit
  // as soon as all clients in the pool are idle, even if their socket is still open
  // to the postgres server.  This can be handy in scripts & tests
  // where you don't want to wait for your clients to go idle before your process exits.
  allowExitOnIdle: false,
 
  // Sets a max overall life for the connection.
  // A value of 60 would evict connections that have been around for over 60 seconds,
  // regardless of whether they are idle. It's useful to force rotation of connection pools through
  // middleware so that you can rotate the underlying servers. The default is disabled (value of zero)
